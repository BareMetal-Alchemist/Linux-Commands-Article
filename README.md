# Linux Commands Article

Linux Commands make up a core component of the Linux experience. It is recommended that anyone interested in diving into the world of Linux should familiarize themselves with these commands. However, before we begin our breakdown of what these commands are, it is crucial to understand the Linux Command Line Interface.

## Linux Command Line Interface

I want you to imagine your average computer experience. You most likely use a mouse to interact with a Guided User Interface (GUI) in order to:

- Open apps  
- Initiate tasks  
- Navigate through the computer as a whole  

This is the modern-day framework for the average user experience when it comes to personal computers. While convenient, let’s take a look at a different scenario.

> Picture you work as a member of an IT Team and are required to do a handful of tasks in a timely manner. This could be anything from:
>
> - Updating software  
> - Troubleshooting services  
> - Responding to cybersecurity incidents  

Utilizing a mouse and navigating between windows is convenient but now you have to:

- Scroll through options  
- Wait for windows to pop up  
- And more...  

Guided User Interfaces are nice to have, but professionals often work in high-paced environments and need more efficiency and control. This is when the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** comes into play.

The CLI is primitive and what computer users in the past utilized before we had the earliest GUIs. Despite that, they have been able to stay relevant thanks to the benefits of:

- Speed  
- Efficiency  
- Control  

Improving one's skills with the CLI comes with the ability to:

- Run updates  
- Enumerate tasks  
- Install software  
- Execute forensics procedures  

All within one window, with no need to open various windows.

This is why it is highly recommended to learn your way around the CLI so that you could be a competitive candidate for professional IT/Tech jobs.

> All operating systems such as **Windows** and **MacOS** include CLIs, but we will be focusing on **Linux** in this article.

Linux CLIs are often a significant part of the Linux experience, as it is often how you will be installing and updating software on your machine — even if you don’t plan to do any professional tech work.

That is why this article is not only beneficial for aspiring professionals but also for anyone interested in Linux in general.

## Linux Commands

Now that you are familiar with what a CLI is, we will now introduce **Linux commands**.

In order to do anything on a CLI you will need to give it commands. Most commands are a part of what is known as a **scripting language**.

A scripting language can be described as:

- A non-complex programming language
- Mainly used for commanding the operating system of the machine

> The scripting language in use is OS dependent and not universal:

- **Windows** uses PowerShell and Batch  
- **MacOS** currently uses **Z shell (Zsh)**, older versions use **Bourne Again Shell (Bash)**  
- **Linux** makes use of **Bourne Again Shell (Bash)**  

As you can see, each OS has different scripting languages in use which also means that their CLI commands will also be different. However:

- Some scripting languages like Windows’ PowerShell make use of **aliases** and can still compute basic Bash commands
- Learning the commands of one scripting language can make it easier to learn others as well

With that said, you will learn the necessary **Bash commands** needed to do a good amount of work in the Linux CLI.

So let us get started.

## Navigation

Navigating a Linux OS can be done via a guided user interface, but it is much easier to do said navigation...
